Mulholland: a practical Havoc implementation that operates on top of Caterwaul.

mulholland      the self-modifying Perl object containing Waul source
mh-object       a self-modifying Perl object that contains mh:: attributes
mh              a command-line REPL and Mulholland compiler

Perhaps more usefully:

mulholland contains the core Mulholland language implementation as uncompiled
Waul source. It contains function::render, which generates the stuff in src/
and the 'mh' program. It also pre-bootstraps 'mh' during the render process to
make sure that 'mh' can successfully clone itself (and presumably bake in other
stuff).

mh-object is designed for you to inherit from. It contains a copy of the vim
highlighter (auto-installable via function::vim) and knows how to store mh::
attributes. It also importantly contains function::repl, which launches a REPL
using 'mh' (it assumes 'mh' is somewhere in your $PATH).

mh is the fully precompiled output of 'mulholland render'. It is a
self-replicating online/offline compiler and REPL. Its documented source code
is in src/mh/mh.waul; this file describes the command-line options that it
understands and provides frustratingly little useful information otherwise.

MIT licensed as usual, but nobody in their right mind would want to use this.
