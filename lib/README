Mulholland libraries.
These are designed to modify the global environment in 'mh', primarily to make
it easier to use Mulholland to write Javascript.

The canonical version of the library source lives in self-modifying Perl files
that inherit from ../mh-object. One such file is ./jsii. mh-jsii is a version of
../mh with tree.mh and jsii.mh baked in.
