Introduction.
This module provides various forms of low-level Javascript loops with varying degrees of abstraction. These are all modeled as side-effects; other modules provide higher-level looping
constructs that you can use to manipulate values directly.

module @js-loops (_x /for-n _v _n = /@p! @js (/var! (_v = 0); _v < _n; !++ _v) /for {@js _x})
